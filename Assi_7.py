output:
    
1,2

after calling the function we make an obejct for class der which is base awith super class A, 
in fucntion we make an object so init method is called where value of y is retured as 2, but with super().init() 
we call the init of parent class well.
so x is also returned as 1
we print x and y
so out oput is 1,2



prg 3:
    
output:

3,1
 
- function called object for B is created so init is called which return y=0 first and then init of super is also called with value 3 .
  which will return x=3.
- then method count is called which will make the vlue of y as 1, becasue of incremental with 1
- printing x and y, so answer will be 3 anad ,latest returned valued of x and y


prg 4:
    
OUTPUT

30

-object of B created so init will run of class B
-in init super init is called and from super init will call the function multiply, 
it wont execute the function of its own, because its parent class, 
which can not perform any of its own method, 
so it will go to the method of B calculate the sum and print i wwhich will be 30.

with init method of a child class, if the init is being called, 
then other method from parent clas can not be excuted.
